This readme is for running the changeslow, changegreedy and changedp algorithms writting in Python

Please unzip all the files to the same directory:
coinchange.py
changeslow.py
changegreedy.py
changedp.py
Coin1.txt
TestSet.txt

In order to run the algorithms they each need to be called from the command line for instance:
python changeslow.py [Filename].txt

Will use the [filename].txt as the input file, changeslow.py will determine the minimum number of coins required to make change
and also the counts for the types of coints.  The results will be appended to [filename]change.txt

A sample source file called TestSet.txt has been included as well as Coin1.txt
